[WORDPRESS](https://czellejames2.wordpress.com/)


This has taught me a lot, and it's been very fun. I've definitely learned stuff, and I learned how to make a webpage, that looks nice and clean. I learned how to inbed a link in text, and I think my website looks good. I linked my pages on the top where it says OUR PRODUCT at the beginning, and the password for the terms and conditions is 'LULU'. I learned how to link to competing sites, and if yoyou look at the pur product page it says that! I also learned how to put a password on a viewing link like i did, and it's been very helpful. I think all in all i've done alright, and my competitors for the product are Tracky, Alibaba, and kali, all links to sites are at the bottom of the our product page!
