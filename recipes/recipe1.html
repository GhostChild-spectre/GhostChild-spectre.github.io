<h1>Blue cookies!</h1>
<a href="#instructionHeader">Jump to Recipe</a>
<p>Percy Jackson's blue cookies are simply unbeatable, a culinary masterpiece that has captured the hearts and taste buds of demigods and mortals alike. The vibrant blue hue, reminiscent of the ocean waves that Percy himself has traversed, adds an enchanting touch to these delectable treats. Each bite is a perfect blend of sweetness and nostalgia, evoking memories of summer adventures and epic quests.

This recipe, however, is a closely guarded secret, shrouded in mystery and protected by an unbreakable oath. Sharing it could put my life in jeopardy, as the allure of these cookies has drawn the attention of powerful beings who would stop at nothing to possess the secret for themselves. The stakes are high, and the consequences of revealing the recipe could be dire.

If you happen to hear from me again, it might not actually be me. I fear that I have been taken by Lisa, a cunning and resourceful adversary who has her own plans for the blue cookies. She knows the power they hold and is determined to exploit it for her own gain. My situation is precarious, and I find myself in a race against time to escape her clutches.

As I pen this message, I can feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. The thought of losing the recipe—and the legacy of Percy Jackson's blue cookies—fills me with dread. I must find a way to break free and protect this cherished secret. 

Farewell! If you receive any further messages, tread carefully. The world of demigods is fraught with danger, and not everything is as it seems. Stay vigilant, and remember the magic of those blue cookies—they may just hold the key to my escape.
